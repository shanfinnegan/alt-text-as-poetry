    "reflection" : "The combination of the baby leopard pants and “tiny silver high tops” on a toddler stood out to me. These two items signal youthful exuberance. I could also wear leopard print pants and silver high tops, and that could potentially seem “youthful” so to some. As adults, we don’t usually point as shoe size, but for a toddler, using the word “tiny” adds another layer of charm to this already cute description. — Bojana"

    "reflection" : "People who are new to alt-text often think of it as a new skill, but description comes up often in other forms of writing. I used to work as a tour guide at Judd Foundation and read a lot of writing by artist Donald Judd. His approach to art criticism often includes stating what he saw, sometimes in a very matter-of-fact way. This review of the net paintings in Yayoi Kusama's first solo exhibition in New York uses a mix of painting terms (talking about the “space” of the painting, “ground,” “wash”) and analogy to get at both the details of the paintings themselves and the impact they had on Judd. — Shannon"
