    "text" : "Four Parts of the World, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Bronze, 1874: The four parts of the world stand nude and muscular, endeavoring to hold up a sphere that is the world. Asia, bald save for her long braid, pivots a bit, arms raised but not quite in contact with the sphere of the world. She looks over her shoulder, curiously preoccupied with Europe, who stand majestically, arms fully extended above her head, hair upswept in a zephyr of unseen air. Europe’s right hand grasps at an arc of the sphere while the other swings fee behind her back. Her eyes are fixed rapturously on the heavens, mouth slightly ajar. Next to Europe is America, her head crowned with feathers. Her torso twists in the direction of her head, rightward, her eyes downcast, fixed on a land somewhere below Europe’s feet, yet her arms stretch behind her, not reaching up to do the work of holding the sphere, but instead reaching back toward Africa’s waist. Africa, unperturbed, stands in a pose similar to Europe’s. Her arms are outstretched, with one hand grasping the world. Her jaw is set firm; she does not gaze rapturously at the heavens. Instead her eyes are intent, as if on the sparrow of the north star. Her right ankle is shackled to a broken chain resting free on the dais. The broken chain says that she’s free, but America’s large foot bears down upon it. ",

    "reflection" : "Tisa Bryant’s book Unexplained Presence was recommended to me by writer Erinrose Mager when we were talking about alt-text and image description. Interspersed in the book are a series of descriptions of artworks, including the one above. Bryant writes in the preface: “Black figures in Eurocentric literature, film, and visual art are rarely presented without being give a distinct, racialized function, the import of which often goes largely undisputed, if not wholly unacknowledged simply because the power of saying, of naming and describing it, has been withheld.” In this book, Bryant expertly uses description as a creative form, illuminating and subverting the racial power dynamics that determine who describes and what they describe. Highly recommend this book! —Shannon"

This review of the net paintings in Yayoi Kusama's first solo exhibition in New York uses a mix of painting terms (talking about the “space” of the painting, “ground,” “wash”) and analogy to get at both the details of the paintings themselves and the impact they had on Judd. — Shannon"
