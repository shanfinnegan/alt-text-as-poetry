          <p class="large">First off, some context. We, <span class="flower rotating" role="img" aria-label="a spinning eight-petalled flower">❁</span> Shannon and <span class="flower rotating" role="img" aria-label="a spinning five-petalled flower">❀</span> Bojana, are both disabled artists and activists. We met in New York through mutual friends around the time Shannon was first thinking about alt-text. We realized there was a lot of overlap between our interests and decided to jump into this collaborative project.</p>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">What is alt-text?</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text (or alternative text) is a written description of an image posted online.</p>
            <p class="medium">It has multiple uses, but we are focused on its role as an essential part of web accessibility.</p>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, have low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p class="medium">For sighted people, alt-text is typically invisible.</p>
            <p class="medium">Here is an example of an image with alt-text:</p>
            <figure class="alt-text-example">
              <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dab74f90-05f8-457b-bc96-450402ae5aad%2Ftaichi-hat.jpg?v=1587162430175" alt="Taichi is sitting in a cafe, looking downward at his phone. He wears a black bucket hat sprinkled with embroidered flowers of various bright colors."/>
            </figure>
            <p class="medium">You may not see the alt-text here because it's only readable by screen readers or viewable in the source of this website. But if you, for instance, install this bookmarklet (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alt-text-tester/koldhcllpbdfcdpfpbldbicbgddglodk?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup-alt-attribute/">Firefox</a>), and mouse over the image, you'll be able to better read the alt-text. It may look something like <a href="https://cdn.glitch.com/dab74f90-05f8-457b-bc96-450402ae5aad%2Ftaichi-hat-screenshot.png?v=1587163001296" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
            <p class="medium">Blind people often use software called screen readers to access digital displays. The screen reader outputs the text on the screen to a synthetic voice or refreshable braille display. On a website, a screen reader might readout options in the navigation bar, followed by the title, the first paragraph, the second paragraph, etc. When a screen reader encounters an image, it’s unable to “read” it. So instead, it looks for the alt-text — an associated description of the image, embedded in the code. This is how alt-text functions as a non-visual alternative to an image.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">What we think about alt-text</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text is an essential part of web accessibility. It is a system of text descriptions built into websites, which makes visual content accessible to blind people and people with low vision. Alt-text has existed since the 1990s, but it is often overlooked altogether or understood solely through the lens of compliance. The resulting alt-text is often written in a reluctant, perfunctory style, but it has tremendous expressive potential.</p>
            <p class="medium">This project reframes alt-text as a type of poetry and provides opportunities to talk about it and practice writing it. We don’t just want alt-text users to be able to access visual content on the internet, we want them to feel a sense of belonging in digital spaces.</p>
            <p class="medium">Both of us are interested in how communities can move towards better and more nuanced approaches to access. Instead of focusing on compliance and doing the minimum, what if we approach access creatively and generously, centering disability culture? How do we make spaces and experiences that disabled people not only can access but want to access?</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">Why think of alt-text as poetry?</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Framing alt-text as a type of poetry allows us to approach it with some of the ideas and strategies that have been developed by poets.</p>
            <p class="medium">That said, we’re not interested in producing alt-text poetry that exists outside of making the internet more accessible. We recognize that others have used alt-text and code as inspiration and media for poetry, but for us, increasing website accessibility remains the first and most important condition of alt-text’s poetic potential.</p>
            <p class="medium">Here are three ideas from the world of poetry that we have found to be particularly helpful when writing alt-text:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>1. Attention to Language</h4>
                <p class="medium">Simply by writing alt-text with thought and care, we shift the process. What words are we using? What are their connotations? What is the tone of our writing (the way in which we’re doing the writing)? What is the voice (who the reader hears)? How do these align with, or contrast, the tone and perspective of the image?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>2. Word Economy</h4>
                <p class="medium">People who are new to description have a tendency to over-describe images. While there are times for long and lavish descriptions, alt-text usually aims for brevity. For most images, one to two sentences will do. Poetry has a lot to teach us about paring down language to create something that is expressive, yet concise.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>3. Experimental Spirit</h4>
                <p class="medium">We have so much to learn from poetry about being more playful and exploratory in how we write alt-text. We are not interested in experimentation for experimentation’s sake — we want a kind of experimentation that moves towards better and more nuanced accessibility for alt-text users. There are lots of complex and interesting questions that come up when translating visual information into text. We need to try out different ways of doing this, learning from each other's strategies and techniques.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">Our intent with this project</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">The purpose of this project is not to tell you how to write alt-text. There are many existing resources that provide guidelines and how-tos (you can find a few listed in the <a class="scroll" href="#tools">Tools</a> section).</p>
            <p class="medium">Our primary intent is to put alt-text on your radar (if it wasn’t already), to get you thinking about it creatively, and to explore a few of the key questions that come up when translating images into text.</p>
            <p class="medium">We hope what you read and experience here makes clear that, like all accessibility practices, writing alt-text requires ongoing practice, learning, and collaboration.</p>
            <p class="medium">We also want to note that our thinking about alt-text is shifting and changing all the time. And of course, people have lots of different opinions about how to approach alt-text. So take all of this with a grain of salt, seek out alternate viewpoints, and feel free to disagree.</p>

            <div class="portrait-flower" aria-label="A symbol of a flower, consisting of five outlined petals and a five-pointed star in the center">❀</div>
            <p class="medium">I am a visual artist, activist, and scholar. I focused my MA studies on the intersection of Disability Studies and Art Administration. This included an internship at the Whitney Museum of Art in its Access and Community program and participation in the 2018 Kennedy Center International conference on Leadership Exchange in the Arts and Disability. In 2019, I curated Crip Imponderabilia a groundbreaking show for the NYU Gallatin Gallery. I’m also currently on the NYU Advisory Committee for the Kimmel Gallery and have done consulting work for The Whitney, NYU Gallatin Galleries, and the New York Jewish Museum. I have also worked as an artist and grassroots access organizer in the Jersey City community for decades, curating events and exhibits featuring disabled artists. In 2020, I am completing a 2019-2020 Fulbright Research Grant in the Czech Republic, focusing my research on access in the arts for disabled people.</p>
            <p class="medium">I’m a smiley white woman with a chin-length brunette bob. I’m about 5-feet 6-inches, easing into my 40s and usually have my white cane with me when outside. Tonight, I’m wearing a typical outfit of late, a graphic black and white t-shirt, cherry red cardigan and black jeans.</p>

            <div class="portrait-flower" aria-label="A symbol of a flower, consisting of eight outlined petals and a circle in the center">❁</div>
            <p class="medium">I’m a multidisciplinary artist making work about disability culture and accessibility. I’ve done projects with The Banff Centre, Tallinn Art Hall, The Invisible Dog, Friends of the High Line, and the Wassaic Project. I’ve spoken at the Brooklyn Museum, School for Poetic Computation, The 8th Floor, Data & Society, and The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. In 2018, I received a Wynn Newhouse Award and participated in Art Beyond Sight’s Art + Disability Residency. In 2019, I was a resident at Eyebeam.</p>
            <p class="medium">I’m a 5-foot-2-inch, blond, white person. I’m a fairly small person and I’m in my early 30s, though people often tell me I look younger. My disability affects my walking so I move with a slight wobble. I’m currently writing from home where I’m wearing a blue, gingham PJ-set.</p>

              By Carolyn Lazard, Commissioned by Recess<br/>
              <a href="">Project website</a><br/>
              <p><em>Accessibility in the Arts: A Promise and a Practice</em> is an accessibility guide geared toward small-scale arts nonprofits and the potentially expansive publics these organizations serve. It details specific ways in which disabled people are excluded from cultural spaces and offers possible solutions to those barriers. Moving away from historical and juridical definitions of accessibility, this guide considers the unique capacity of small scale arts organizations to meet the needs of disabled communities. It engages principles of disability justice to think through what can urgently be done to create more equitable and accessible arts spaces.</p>

          <p class="large">This project is part of an elaborate and rich ecosystem of work around this topic. None of these ideas are new — disabled people have been asking for and producing thoughtful and creative approaches to alt-text and description for a long time. This work is only possible because of the decades of thinking, writing, dreaming, and organizing disabled people have done to shape how we understand access in general. It exists alongside the important work about description that’s being done by many other artists and thinkers.</p>
          <p class="large">These are a few on our radar, but certainly, there are many more.</p>
