We, <span class="flower rotating" role="img" aria-label="a spinning eight-petalled flower">❁</span> Shannon and <span class="flower rotating" role="img" aria-label="a spinning five-petalled flower">❀</span> Bojana, are both disabled artists and activists. We met in New York through mutual friends around the time Shannon was first thinking about alt-text. We realized there was a lot of overlap between our interests and decided to jump into this collaborative project.</p>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">What is alt-text?</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text is a written description of an image posted online. Alt-text can also be added to images embedded in digital documents (PDFs, Word documents, Google docs, presentations, etc).</p>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text has multiple uses, but we are focused on its role as an essential part of web accessibility.</p>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p class="medium">Blind people typically use software called a screen reader to access digital displays. The screen reader goes through the text on the screen and outputs it to a synthetic voice or refreshable braille display. On a website, a screen reader might readout options in the navigation bar, followed by the title, the first paragraph, the second paragraph, etc. When a screen reader encounters an image, it’s unable to “read” it. So instead, it looks for the alt-text — a description of the image embedded in the code — and reads it out. This is how alt-text functions as a non-visual alternative to an image.</p>
            <p class="medium">Here is an example of an image with alt-text:</p>
            <figure class="alt-text-example">
              <img src="assets/flower-hat.png" alt="Taichi is sitting in a cafe, looking downward at his phone. He wears a black bucket hat sprinkled with embroidered flowers of various bright colors."/>
            </figure>
            <p class="medium">You can’t see alt-text here because only readable by screen readers or viewable in the source code of this website. But if you, for instance, install this bookmarklet (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alt-text-tester/koldhcllpbdfcdpfpbldbicbgddglodk?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup-alt-attribute/">Firefox</a>), and mouse over the image, the alt-text displays visually on the screen. It may look something like <a href="./assets/taichi-hat-screenshot.png" target="_blank">this</a>.You can also check out the alt-text by turning on your screen reader (many devices have built-in screen reading software) or by using the "Inspect Element" browser tool.</p>

            <summary><h3 class="large">What we think about alt-text</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Alt-text has existed since the 1990s, but it is often overlooked altogether or understood solely through the lens of compliance. The resulting alt-text is often written in a reluctant, perfunctory style, but it has tremendous expressive potential.</p>
            <p class="medium">This project reframes alt-text as a type of poetry and provides opportunities to talk about it and practice writing it. We don’t just want alt-text users to be able to access visual content on the internet, we want them to feel a sense of belonging in digital spaces.</p>
            <p class="medium">Both of us are interested in how communities can move towards better and more nuanced approaches to access. Instead of focusing on compliance and doing the minimum, what if we approach access creatively and generously, centering disability culture? How do we make spaces and experiences that disabled people not only <i>can</i> access but <i>want</i> to access?</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">Why think of alt-text as poetry?</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">Framing alt-text as a type of poetry allows us to approach it with some of the ideas and strategies that have been developed by poets.</p>
            <p class="medium">That said, we’re not interested in producing alt-text poetry that exists outside of making the internet more accessible. We recognize that others have used alt-text and code as inspiration and media for poetry, but for us, increasing website accessibility remains the first and most important condition of alt-text’s poetic potential.</p>
            <p class="medium">Here are three ideas from the world of poetry that we have found to be particularly helpful when writing alt-text:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>1. Attention to Language</h4>
                <p class="medium">Simply by writing alt-text with thought and care, we shift the process. What words are we using? What are their connotations? What is the tone of our writing (the way in which we’re doing the writing)? What is the voice (who the reader hears)? How do these align with, or contrast, the tone and perspective of the image?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>2. Word Economy</h4>
                <p class="medium">People who are new to description have a tendency to over-describe images. While there are times for long and lavish descriptions, alt-text usually aims for brevity. For most images, one to two sentences will do. Poetry has a lot to teach us about paring down language to create something that is expressive, yet concise.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>3. Experimental Spirit</h4>
                <p class="medium">We have so much to learn from poetry about being more playful and exploratory in how we write alt-text. We are not interested in experimentation for experimentation’s sake — we want a kind of experimentation that moves towards better and more nuanced accessibility for alt-text users. There are lots of complex and interesting questions that come up when translating visual information into text. We need to try out different ways of doing this, learning from each other's strategies and techniques.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary><h3 class="large">Our intent with this project</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">The purpose of this project is not to tell you how to write alt-text. There are many existing resources that provide guidelines and how-tos (you can find a few listed in the <a class="scroll" href="#tools">Tools</a> section).</p>
            <p class="medium">Our primary intent is to put alt-text on your radar (if it wasn’t already), to get you thinking about it creatively, and to explore a few of the key questions that come up when translating images into text.</p>
            <p class="medium">We hope what you read and experience here makes clear that, like all accessibility practices, writing alt-text requires ongoing practice, learning, and collaboration.</p>
            <p class="medium">We also want to note that our thinking about alt-text is shifting and changing all the time. And of course, people have lots of different opinions about how to approach alt-text. So take all of this with a grain of salt, seek out alternate viewpoints, and feel free to disagree.</p>

            <div class="portrait-flower" aria-label="A symbol of a flower, consisting of five outlined petals and a five-pointed star in the center">❀</div>
            <p class="medium">I am a visual artist, activist, and scholar. I focused my MA studies on the intersection of Disability Studies and Art Administration. This included an internship at the Whitney Museum of Art in its Access and Community program and participation in the 2018 Kennedy Center International conference on Leadership Exchange in the Arts and Disability. In 2019, I curated Crip Imponderabilia a groundbreaking show for the NYU Gallatin Gallery. I’m also currently on the NYU Advisory Committee for the Kimmel Gallery and have done consulting work for The Whitney, NYU Gallatin Galleries, and the New York Jewish Museum. I have also worked as an artist and grassroots access organizer in the Jersey City community for decades, curating events and exhibits featuring disabled artists. In 2020, I am completing a 2019-2020 Fulbright Research Grant in the Czech Republic, focusing my research on access in the arts for disabled people.</p>
            <p class="medium">I’m a smiley white woman with a chin-length brunette bob. I’m about 5-feet 6-inches, easing into my 40s and usually have my white cane with me when outside. Tonight, I’m wearing a typical outfit of late, a graphic black and white t-shirt, cherry red cardigan and black jeans.</p>

            <div class="portrait-flower" aria-label="A symbol of a flower, consisting of eight outlined petals and a circle in the center">❁</div>
            <p class="medium">I’m a multidisciplinary artist making work about disability culture and accessibility. I’ve done projects with The Banff Centre, Tallinn Art Hall, The Invisible Dog, Friends of the High Line, and the Wassaic Project. I’ve spoken at the Brooklyn Museum, School for Poetic Computation, The 8th Floor, Data & Society, and The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. In 2018, I received a Wynn Newhouse Award and participated in Art Beyond Sight’s Art + Disability Residency. In 2019, I was a resident at Eyebeam.</p>
            <p class="medium">I’m a 5-foot-2-inch, blond, white person. I’m a fairly small person and I’m in my early 30s, though people often tell me I look younger. My disability affects my walking so I move with a slight wobble. I’m currently writing from home where I’m wearing a blue, gingham PJ-set.</p>

              <p><em>Accessibility in the Arts: A Promise and a Practice</em> is an accessibility guide geared toward small-scale arts nonprofits and the potentially expansive publics these organizations serve. It details specific ways in which disabled people are excluded from cultural spaces and offers possible solutions to those barriers. Moving away from historical and juridical definitions of accessibility, this guide considers the unique capacity of small scale arts organizations to meet the needs of disabled communities. It engages principles of disability justice to think through what can urgently be done to create more equitable and accessible arts spaces.</p>

          <p class="large">This project is part of an elaborate and rich ecosystem of work around this topic. None of these ideas are new — disabled people have been asking for and producing thoughtful and creative approaches to alt-text and description for a long time. This work is only possible because of the decades of thinking, writing, dreaming, and organizing disabled people have done to shape how we understand access in general. It exists alongside the important work about description that’s being done by many other artists and thinkers.</p>
          <p class="large">These are a few on our radar, but certainly, there are many more.</p>

            Hello! You’ve reached the end.
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            This website, made for and with ❁ Shannon and ❀ Bojana, has been a collaboration between  us—we are designers & programmers Laurel Schwulst and Taichi Aritomo, sometimes working as “<a href="http://beautiful-company.com">Beautiful Company</a>.”
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            As you know, alt-text describes images. But a website (since it has a visual form) can also be considered a type of image, as its intentionally chosen visual elements can be easily remembered or documented by a screenshot. So here is our visual description of the site:
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            <i>This website has a dark blue background and presents its title, “Alt-Text as Poetry” large and centered at the top. Below the title appear brightly colored navigation buttons (each section is differentiated through a special color), and underneath those, a welcome message cheerfully announces itself with an arc of white flower icons. And throughout the entire site, even more flower icons are sprinkled about… and some other decorative motifs like floral drop caps and unique pixelated borders appear per section in their respective bright colors. All text on the site is presented in the highly-legible and widely-available Times New Roman serif font.</i>
          </p>
          <p class="medium">
            As the website’s creators, we wanted to provide some context. Below you’ll find some of our writing—why the website looks this way, our process of making the website, and some other technical and philosophical details. Overall, we aimed to make this website inviting, accessible, joyful, and economical. We hope you like it!
          </p>

            <p class="medium">
              We first seriously became interested in alt-text through our work on <a href="http://artistsspace.org">Artists Space’s website</a>, which exposes the alt-text of each image to all viewers.

            <p class="medium">
              We were interested in exploring the relationship between accessibility and authorship through this site’s design.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              Often, accessibility projects are treated in a cold, perfunctory way. But through this website's use of bright colors, floral motifs, and a personal tone—we hoped to invite readers to embrace personal subjectivity as a tool to best translate media to accessible formats.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              We also wanted to be honest about this specific project’s context and authors—it’s made by two individual artists, not an organization, so we wanted it to be economically and joyfully made.

              We were interested in the flower motif because of its inviting nature. Flower motifs often appear on event invitations—like to parties, weddings, etc. And scientifically speaking, literal flowers are invitations to insects—flowers are brightly colored and sometimes scented so that insects are drawn to pollinate them. (Also coincidentally, Taichi was wearing a bucket hat with embroidered flowers during some of our first brainstorming sessions.)

            </summary>
            <p class="small mono">
              I have a friend who’s an artist… and who has sometimes taken a view which I don’t agree with very well. You hold up a flower and say, “Look how beautiful it is” and I’ll agree.
            </p>
            <p class="small mono">
              And he says, “I as an artist can see how beautiful this is. But you as a scientist, oh, take this all apart, and it becomes this dull thing.” And I think he’s kind of nutty.
            </p>
            <p class="small mono">
              First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people, and to me too. I believe, although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, that I can appreciate the beauty of the flower.
            </p>
            <p class="small mono">
              At the same time, I see much more  about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. It’s not just beauty at this dimension at 1cm… there’s also beauty at the smaller dimensions. The inner structure. Also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means the insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions…
            </p>
            <p class="small mono">
              Science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don’t understand how it subtracts.
            </p>

              He describes how a flower can be understood from multiple layers or levels (the artistic, the scientific), and how both layers contribute to our appreciation rather than one subtracting from the other...
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              Maybe sighted people (who translate images into words in order to create alt-text) could consider alt-text this way too. Similar to how the scientific view of a flower only deepens one’s appreciation of the flower’s aesthetic beauty, writing (or reading) the alt-text for an image only adds to our understanding of the image, making it richer and deeper. If sighted writers of alt-text approached their role with such curiosity, the resulting alt-text could better support different modes of understanding and learning.

            <summary><h3 class="large">Web accessibility on this site</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">
              On this site, web accessibility was our top priority.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              While the topic of alt-text is specific to people who can’t see or understand images, on this site we took a holistic approach to web accessibility so that as many different types of people in many different contexts could use our site. (For more information, here is a good <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">overview of web accessibility</a>.)
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              In addition to optimizing our site for a screen reader so that people with visual disabilities can read the site, we also checked for keyboard navigation for those with mobility disabilities and color contrast for low-vision or colorblind people. Our site is also “static,”which means that the site exists on the server as a basic HTML file that is sent to your browser. No complicated, programmatic server processes occur when someone visits the site, so it loads very quickly.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              More on the technical side: This website was mostly written by hand in HTML. Wherever we could, we tried to use semantic HTML elements, which allow information to describe their own structure and purpose in a human- and machine-readable way. Some examples are <code style="background: yellow;">&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, or, for the collapsible sections, <code style="background: peru;">&lt;summary&gt;</code> and <code style="background: cyan;">&lt;detail&gt;</code>. As universal web standards for different web browsers and devices, these elements enable accessible interactivity and provide explicit information hierarchy in the absence of visual indicators.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              Because the website mostly consists of text, we were able to fit all of its contents (save for the extended blog) on a single page. This, we believe, also offers benefits for accessibility. Screenreader users often skim through a page’s contents using the different header levels provided by semantic HTML. On a single-page website, the entire website’s contents are skimmable from one menu, whereas a multi-page website requires screenreader users to search and piece together that structure by visiting multiple pages. Additionally, on a multi-page website, a screenreader would repetitively read the header and navigational elements of each visited page, whereas those elements would only need to be read once on a single-page website.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              From a visual standpoint, we made our text clear and legible. In terms of colors, we chose dark blue because of its associated with accessibility. We liked having the blue as background and white as text because it’s easier on the eyes and also uses less of the computer’s energy. (Presenting white on a screen takes the most energy.) And even though we also used colors other than blue, like in the multicolor navigation and sections, we made sure the contrast between text and background was high enough using <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM’s Contrast Checker</a>. We also used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM’s WAVE tool</a> for a more general accessibility test. 
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              Thanks also to Cortney Glonka, who tested the site for accessibility.

            <summary><h3 class="large">How we made this site</h3></summary>
            <p class="medium">
              This website was begun in February and launched later in June 2020.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              We began with an initial brainstorm meeting between us, Shannon, and <a href="https://www.companion-platform.org/">Companion Platform</a> (Lexi Visco and Calvin Rocchio), the designers who created the printed workbook for this project.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              From there, we assembled some strategic goals and possible design motifs and presented them to Shannon. With Shannon and Bojana’s feedback, the design of this website emerged.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              We were able to collaboratively code through social distancing thanks to the <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> platform. The website now is hosted for free and its code made publicly available through <a href="https://github.com/taichiaritomo/alt-text-as-poetry">Github</a>. If you poke around there, you’ll see we mostly coded it in handwritten <a href="http://html.energy">HTML</a> and CSS. We also used a little bit of JavaScript as glue, specifically for the blog.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              Besides the background, the website’s colors were selected from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#colors_table">147 named CSS colors</a>. Specifically, we used <span style="background: yellow; color: #260069;">yellow</span>, <span style="background: yellowgreen; color: #260069;">yellowgreen</span>, <span style="background: tomato; color: #260069;">tomato</span>, <span style="background: cyan; color: #260069;">cyan</span>, <span style="background: silver; color: #260069;">silver</span>, <span style="background: fuchsia; color: #260069;">fuchsia</span>, <span style="background: peru; color: #260069;">peru</span>, and <span style="background: pink; color: #260069;">pink</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="medium">
              The custom pixelated borders were created using Max Bittker’s “<a href="https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/">broider</a>” tool. (And special thanks to <a href="https://maxbittker.com/"></a>Max</a> for adding custom broider colors for us!)

              I'm a designer, programmer, gardener, and math tutor. I like to think about the ways that beings and things plan and improvise together. Sometimes, I work with ✺ Laurel, making websites like this one or helping her with classes. Last year (2019), I was also a volunteer at the <a href="https://www.adaptivedesign.org/">Adaptive Design Association</a>, an organization that makes bespoke, low-cost adaptations for people with disabilities. And this year (2020), I'll begin pursuing a masters degree in architecture and landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design.

              I'm a Japanese-American in my mid-twenties. I have a skinny frame, and I’m 5 feet and 10 inches tall. My black hair is cut with a few bangs over my forehead, and the rest of it is held back with a cheap plastic band, curling slightly at the ends below my ears. People tell me I have big eyes, but I slept so much this weekend that one of my eyelids didn’t fold right this morning. I'm wearing navy blue sweatshorts made of heavyweight terry cotton and a navy blue t-shirt that I found in my grandparents' closet. I'm at home, sitting at my desk on a yellow plastic chair from Hay. Through my window I can smell fresh-cut grass and hear people talking outside.

              I’m an artist, designer, writer, programmer, and teacher interested in ambiance and the internet. Some of my favorite projects I’ve worked on include: <a href="https://flightsimulator.soft.works/">Flight Simulator</a>, an “ode to airplane mode” — a novel travel app for iOS and Android; <a href="http://perfume-area.com">Perfume Area</a>, a book of poetic, lyrical perfume reviews; <a href="https://artistsspace.org">Artists Space’s website</a>, which through multiple entrances allows generous traversal through its rich archive and also features exposed alt-text (created with ❋ Taichi and others); and most recently <a href="http://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a>, a website workshop for people with idea seeds whose soil is equally code and culture. I’ve also taught design courses at Yale, Princeton, Rutgers, and California College of the Arts and was previously creative director of Kickstarter’s <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com">The Creative Independent</a> and designer and front-end developer at <a href="https://linkedbyair.net">Linked by Air</a>.

            <p class="medium">I’m a 5-foot-4-inch slightly wavy brown-haired white person with hazel eyes. I’m in my early 30s, and typically people think I look younger, and sometimes I’m mistaken for a student and other times people tell me I have a nice smile. I’m currently writing from my kitchen table at home, where it’s early afternoon and I’m wearing a bright yellow t-shirt, gray sweatpants, and my favorite Mont-Bell “sock-on” house sandals. I’m listening to dreamy club music from the early 2000s and the sun is shining behind rainclouds through my window.</p>
